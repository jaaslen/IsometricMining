This is a mining game based in isometric perspective, It is unfinished, and this is moreso a way of saving my revisions, as this is only playable within the Godot editor for now.
It is coded entirely within the Godot game engine.
If you are interested in seeing the data used for the game, (exact ore rarities, etc.) 
then here is the link to a spreadsheet I used: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dcqrPa2Oz8lTYyx-V2MXr_ye-x5gexULq7xX7FrgTDU/edit?gid=741192721#gid=741192721
